# Topic : WebSockets
This project is a replica of **Hangman** which is a simple word game guessing game.
This is like a multi-client / multi-player application where people can connect to the server to play the game.
For the player to win the game he need to guess the word before he runs out of lives.
The words correctly got by the clients are visible to other people in the group to easily guess the word with less number of lives
